# mazesolver_py

- Thanks for stopping by
- This project is in progress
- There'll be less to no activity for a couple of weeks, because it requires depth-first-search to add the new functionality, so I'm focusing on learning that part before I get back to building the mazesolver
- The objective of this project is to create a maze in a blank canvas and solve it, It uses the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) module to import the canvas and widget functionality.
- You can try running the project in your local system(assuming that it's a Linux system or WSL)
- fork the project and clone it in your workspace
- Open your terminal(ctrl + alt + t) and execute 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mazesolver_py.git
```
- [Install the neccessary dependencies to run the program](https://gist.github.com/KiranSatyaRaj/1b99f51c3c5833132a14a923c945d3a5)

- Change into project directory and run the main file 
```bash
cd mazesolver_py && python main.py
```
- This should be the output

- If you are on windows, I recommend installing WSL(windows sub-system for linux), you can skip this if you already have git-bash installed.
