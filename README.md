# mazesolver_py

- This project is in progress.
- But you can try running the project in your local system(assuming that it's a Linux system)
- Open terminal(ctrl + alt + t) and execute 
```bash
cd && git clone https://github.com/KiranSatyaRaj/mazesolver_py.git
```
- Change into project directory and run the main file 
```bash
cd mazesolver_py && python main.py
```
- If you are on windows, I recommend installing WSL(windows sub-system for linux), you can skip this if you already have git-bash installed.
